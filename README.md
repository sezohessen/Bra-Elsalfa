### Code Consistency Rules

In order to maintain a consistent and understandable codebase, it is important to follow some code consistency rules. These rules will help ensure that the code is easy to read, maintain, and understand. Here are some examples of code consistency rules that you should follow:

1. **Namespace should match directory structure:** Use PascalCase for namespaces and ensure that they match the directory structure. For example, `namespace App\Repositories;` should match the directory `app/Repositories`.

2. **Separate different code elements with empty lines:** Use empty lines to separate namespaces, classes, methods, and properties. This will make your code easier to read and understand.

3. **Class names should match file names:** Use PascalCase for class names and ensure that the file name matches the class name. For example, `class PlayerRepository` should be defined in `PlayerRepository.php`.

4. **Use DocBlock comments to document code:** Use DocBlock comments to document classes, methods, and properties. For example, `/** * Summary of PlayerRepository */` is a DocBlock comment.

5. **Implement interfaces to enforce structure:** Use interface implementation (e.g., `implements RepositoryInterface`) to enforce a contract and ensure the code adheres to a specific structure.

6. **Use camelCase for method names:** Use camelCase for method names. For example, `public function getAll()`.

7. **Use type hints for type safety:** Use type hints in method definitions to enforce type safety. For example, `public function getAll(): Collection`.

8. **Use nullables to define null values:** Use nullables to define that a method can return null. For example, `public function getOne($id): ?Game`.

9. **Use method chaining for cleaner code:** Use method chaining to write cleaner, more readable code. For example, `$game->players()->syncWithoutDetaching($gamePlayerData);`.

10. **Always return a value at the end of a function:** Use `return` statements consistently and at the end of a function to ensure that a function always returns a value. For example, `return false;` at the end of `delete` method.

11. **Use consistent indentation:** Use consistent indentation, for example, four spaces per indentation level. This makes the code easier to read and understand.

12. **Use consistent variable names:** Use the same variable names and conventions throughout the codebase, for example, using `$game` consistently to refer to the `Game` object.

13. **Use meaningful variable names:** Use meaningful variable names to make the code easier to read and understand. For example, `$gamePlayerData` is a meaningful name.

14. **Use single quotes for string literals:** Use single quotes for string literals unless the string contains variables or escape sequences. For example, `'game_theme_id'`.

15. **Use a space between keywords and opening parentheses:** Use a space between keywords and opening parentheses, for example, `if ($player) {`.

16. **Use descriptive function and variable names:** Use descriptive function and variable names, and avoid abbreviations or cryptic names. For example, `getOne()` is a descriptive function name.

17. **Use consistent formatting:** Use consistent formatting, for example, `protected $keyType = 'string';` and `public $incrementing = false;`.

18. **Use a consistent coding style:** Use a consistent coding style throughout the codebase. For example, always use curly braces for control structures, even if they are optional.

By following these code consistency rules, you can ensure that your code is easy to read, maintain, and understand, making it easier for other developers to
