Sure, I can provide some examples of code consistency rules for each line of code:

1. Namespace should be in PascalCase and match the directory structure. For example, `namespace App\Repositories;` matches the directory `app/Repositories`.
2. Use an empty line to separate namespaces, classes, methods, and properties.
3. Class names should be in PascalCase and the file name should match the class name. For example, `class PlayerRepository` is defined in `PlayerRepository.php`.
4. Use DocBlock comments to document classes, methods, and properties. For example, `/** * Summary of PlayerRepository */` is a DocBlock comment.
5. Use interface implementation (e.g., `implements RepositoryInterface`) to enforce a contract and ensure the code adheres to a specific structure.
6. Use camelCase for method names. For example, `public function getAll()`.
7. Use type hints in method definitions to enforce type safety. For example, `public function getAll(): Collection`.
8. Use nullables to define that a method can return null. For example, `public function getOne($id): ?Game`.
9. Use method chaining to write cleaner, more readable code. For example, `$game->players()->syncWithoutDetaching($gamePlayerData);`.
10. Use `return` statements consistently and at the end of a function to ensure that a function always returns a value. For example, `return false;` at the end of `delete` method.
11. Use consistent indentation, for example, four spaces per indentation level. This makes the code easier to read and understand.
12. Use the same variable names and conventions throughout the codebase, for example, using `$game` consistently to refer to the `Game` object.
13. Use meaningful variable names to make the code easier to read and understand. For example, `$gamePlayerData` is a meaningful name.
14. Use single quotes for string literals unless the string contains variables or escape sequences. For example, `'game_theme_id'`.
15. Use a space between keywords and opening parentheses, for example, `if ($player) {`.
16. Use descriptive function and variable names, and avoid abbreviations or cryptic names. For example, `getOne()` is a descriptive function name.
17. Use consistent formatting, for example, `protected $keyType = 'string';` and `public $incrementing = false;`.
18. Use a consistent coding style throughout the codebase. For example, always use curly braces for control structures, even if they are optional.
